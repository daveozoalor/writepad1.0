# Writepad 

Writepad is a android and iOS note taking app with nice page transitions built with [Jquery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [Jquery](http://jquery.com) and SQLite.
It enables users to create, read and update typed notes on their phones or browser.

## How to


## Download the app and run on web browser

* To run it on your browser, you need to have it run from a webserver. A good example is if you have wampserver, copy it to your /www folder
then view it from your browser

* You can also convert it to an android app using cordova command line build or upload it to your free account on [Phonegap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) and have it converted to and android/iOS app for you in seconds. 

```
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/project-162854887831486239.appspot.com/o {
    match /{userId}/{timestamp}/{fileName} {
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read;
    }
  }
}
```
Otherwise you could be getting errors such as 
`firebase error: storage unauthorized` 
`firebase error: permission denied` and
`firebase error: 403 not found, user does not have permission to access /image`
